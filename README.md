# mortgage-valuers mockup
This mockup is a commissioned work with a specific and provided design.  My job was to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build the provided front-end designs (contained in PDF files) on a static page.  This page is also mobile-responsive.

This is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and tools such as bootstrap and simpler-sidebar.js.
